 Discord Bot developed to automate tasks & increase productivity in the "PV Cav" discord server for playing the game "War of Rights"

Functions:

- !map [mapname] -> fetches information about the requested map from "info/[mapname].txt" and the map itself from "img/[mapname].txt" and posts it in an embed in the discord channel the bot was called in
- !topposter -> fetches the names of everyone who has posted in the channel the bot was called in, and provides the number of posts each person has posted in the channel
